- [x] change force of selectable entities to match the player
- [x] change visibility of rendering objects to the same force as the player
- [x] change visibility of highlight entities to a single player
- [x] handle player changing force while in non idle state
- [ ] add player reach restriction
- [x] impl disabled custom drop vectors
- [x] impl only perpendicular
- [x] impl only perpendicular and diagonal
- [x] detect and support inserters with already longer base range than 1
- [ ] support the technologies from bobinsters
  - [ ] make inserter caches per force
- [x] don't do anything if the inserter doesn't support runtime changeable vectors
- [ ] maybe add some animations
  - [ ] happy little popup at both the pickup and drop positions (squares getting bigger and transparent)
  - [ ] with it lines connecting the 2, and a circle on the inserter base itself
  - [ ] do it in a way where there isn't any overlapping lines, so transparency doesn't screw us
- [ ] maybe add very transparent white rendering in each tile that you can actually interact with
- [ ] estimate inserter speed
- [ ] add feature where you can place the inserter using this mods key bind and it will automatically uses the same pickup and drop vectors as the last modified inserter, if they have the same dimensions.
- [ ] maybe add another key bind to place an inserter and instantly enter the configuration mode
  - [ ] upon entering, clear the cursor
  - [ ] upon leaving, restore the cursor, if possible and if it didn't change through other means in the mean time
- [ ] support ghosts, if possible (I think it is)
- [x] support inserters of any size, and off grid
- [ ] handle multiplayer
  - [ ] switch to idle when leaving
  - [ ] ignore interactions with entities that are placed for a different player
  - [ ] prevent 2 players from interacting with the same inserter at the same time
  - [ ] add force restriction
- [ ] what should happen if the inserter gets rotated while the grid/overlay is active?
- [ ] update existing grids/arrows/invisible entities whenever tech level or inserter prototype changes
- [ ] listen to destroy events to switch to idle as soon as possible
- [x] maybe add a rendering circle on the inserter itself
- [ ] maybe detect inserters that are by default diagonal and allow them to be diagonal first, then perpendicular after research
