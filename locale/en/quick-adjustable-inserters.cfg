qai-more-inserters-1=Allows inserters to reach both cardinal and diagonal tiles.
qai-more-inserters-2=Allows inserters to reach every single tile within range, so the full grid.

[controls]
qai-adjust=Adjust inserter

[mod-setting-name]
qai-near-inserters=Technology Near inserters
qai-long-inserters-1=Technology for Long inserters 1
qai-long-inserters-2=Technology for Long inserters 2
qai-more-inserters-1=Technology for More inserters 1
qai-more-inserters-2=Technology for More inserters 2
qai-normalize-default-vectors=Normalize default vectors
qai-show-throughput-on-inserter=Show throughput on inserter
qai-show-throughput-on-pickup=Show throughput on pickup
qai-show-throughput-on-drop=Show throughput on drop
qai-highlight-default-drop-offset=Highlight default drop offset
qai-pipette-after-place-and-adjust=Pipette after place & adjust
qai-pipette-copies-vectors=Pipette copies vectors
qai-mirrored-inserters-only=Mirrored inserters only

[mod-setting-description]
qai-near-inserters=Should the Near inserters technology exist to allow adjusting the drop position within a tile?
qai-long-inserters-1=Should the Long inserters 1 technology exist to increase the range of inserters to a maximum of 2?
qai-long-inserters-2=Should the Long inserters 2 technology exist to increase the range of inserters to a maximum of 3?
qai-more-inserters-1=Should the More inserters 1 technology exist to allow inserters to pickup/drop to/from cardinal as well as diagonal tiles within range?
qai-more-inserters-2=Should the More inserters 2 technology exist to allow inserters to pickup/drop to/from every single tile within range, so the full grid?
qai-normalize-default-vectors=Should the mod attempt to snap the pickup and drop vectors of all adjustable inserters to "valid" vectors? Disabling this may cause some inserters to have default vectors which once modified cannot be restored again. However if this causes compatibility issues, it can be disabled.
qai-show-throughput-on-inserter=Show estimated inserter throughput when hovering any inserter.
qai-show-throughput-on-pickup=Show estimated inserter throughput when adjusting the pickup position.
qai-show-throughput-on-drop=Show estimated inserter throughput when adjusting the drop position.
qai-highlight-default-drop-offset=While adjusting the drop position highlight the drop offset within a tile which is determined to be the default.
qai-pipette-after-place-and-adjust=Automatically pipette (__CONTROL__smart-pipette__) the inserter after having used __CONTROL__qai-adjust__ to place an inserter and having adjusted said placed inserter.
qai-pipette-copies-vectors=When using pipette (__CONTROL__smart-pipette__) on an inserter, so long as it is held in cursor newly placed inserters will have have the same pickup and drop vectors.
qai-mirrored-inserters-only=When enabled, inserters are only allowed to have pickup and drop positions/tiles exactly opposite of each other, mirrored at the center of the inserter.

[qai]
cant-change-inserter-at-runtime=The pickup and drop positions for this inserter type cannot be changed at runtime.
cant-adjust-enemy-inserters=Cannot adjust enemy inserters.
only-one-player-can-adjust=Only 1 player can adjust an inserter at a time.
